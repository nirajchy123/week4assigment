    <p>Being a highly diverse country, Nepal is rich in natural beauty and natural destinations. The country fosters
        innumerable gifts full of wonders, serenely complimenting the state of solitude. There are no words to honestly
        describe Nepal natural wonders and the grandeur of the snowy Himalayan peaks. Nepal natural wonders offer a
        heaven-like pulchritude found nowhere else on Earth with the massive Himalayan glaciers, the pristine lakes,
        waterfalls, and the verdant forests that cover the land like an emerald carpet. This article will discuss some
        of Nepal famous natural destinations Renewable resources: These resources can be replenished naturally. Some of
        these resources, like solar energy, air, wind, water, etc. are continuously available and their quantities are
        not noticeably affected by human consumption. Though many renewable resources do not have such a rapid recovery
        rate, these resources are susceptible to depletion by over-use. Resources from a human use perspective are
        classified as renewable so long as the rate of replenishment/recovery exceeds that of the rate of consumption.
        They replenish easily compared to non-renewable resources.</p>
